Ideas:

Game of Life 2 (might be too elaborate)
- Given a Cartesian coordinate system to represent an aerial view of a field/environment, we can use a nearest-neighbor search algorithm to find a cluster of desired coordinates.
    - Example, a hummingbird (or any other animal) is searching for a flower field with the most of a certain type of flower. 
    - Flowers can be represented as coordinates.
    - Flowers can vary in distance from each other.
    - “Bird” will search for an area with the most flowers that all have shortest distances from each other relative to other places.
  - Coordinate data can be randomly generated each iteration of the program. These coordinates are stored in the 2-d tree.  

Find Closest Object/Destination (simpler version of game of life 2)
- Nearest neighbor search using euclidean distance.
    -Employ search method to calculate shortest distance node stored in the 2-d tree (x, y coords).
